# express-locallibrary-tutorial

Did this project as part of [Express Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) of [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Not all the code in this repo are taken from the tutorial. I wrote some myself, to complete the challenges given in the tutorial.
